<h2>Hi</h2>
<p>Welcome to this page. It is currently useless for most people except myself, since it only contains simple pieces of code in different disciplines such ass regular programming (C-sharp, Java, Javascript, PHP, HTML/CSS etc).
If the quality and contents grows into something worth showing to anyone, this text wouldn't be here.</p>
<p>Currently (as of november 2022) the material is mostly related to introductory courses at a university in southern Sweden.</p>
